> pls review the most recent 15  repos here: https://github.com/orgs/Axiomatic-AI/repositories .. and 
install teh MCPs you'll see listed. 

then, our purpose tonight: craete some AI agentic workflows. 

set it up in a way that the workflow is self-improving

get impressive visuals of the work, which should focus on math, physics, and engineering. 
] 

⏺ I'll help you review the Axiomatic-AI repositories, install the MCPs, and create self-improving AI
  agentic workflows with impressive visuals focused on math, physics, and engineering.

  Let me start by fetching information about the repositories:

⏺ Fetch(https://github.com/orgs/Axiomatic-AI/repositories)
  ⎿  Received 203.7KB (200 OK)

⏺ Let me get more details on the ax-mcp repository and check for installation instructions:

⏺ Fetch(https://github.com/Axiomatic-AI/ax-mcp)
  ⎿  Received 354.7KB (200 OK)

⏺ Great! I found the Axiomatic MCP servers. Before I proceed with installation, I need to clarify: do
  you have an Axiomatic API key? According to the documentation, you need to request one via their
  Google Form.

  Let me check if there's a configuration file for Claude Code and see what the current directory
  structure looks like:

⏺ Bash(ls -la)
  ⎿  total 0                                           
     drwxr-xr-x   2 englund  staff   64 Oct  4 19:44 .
     drwxr-xr-x  10 englund  staff  320 Oct  4 19:44 ..

⏺ Bash(find ~ -name "claude_desktop_config.json" -o -name ".claude_code_config.json" 2>/dev/null | head -5)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Let me check the standard Claude Code config location:

⏺ Bash(ls -la ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/ 2>/dev/null || echo "Claude config directory not
      found")
  ⎿  Claude config directory not found

⏺ Bash(which uvx)
  ⎿  Error: uvx not found

⏺ Found the Axiomatic MCP servers! They provide:
  - 🖌️ AxEquationExplorer - Compose equations from scientific papers
  - 📄 AxDocumentParser - PDF to markdown with OCR
  - 📝 AxDocumentAnnotator - Intelligent PDF annotations
  - 🔬 AxPhotonicsPreview - Photonic circuit design via natural language
  - 📊 AxPlotToData - Extract data from plot images

  To proceed, I need:
  1. Your Axiomatic API key (request at their Google Form if you don't have one)
  2. Install uv package manager (required for MCP installation)

  Let me install uv first:

⏺ Bash(curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh)
  ⎿  no checksums to verify                 
     installing to /Users/englund/.local/bin
       uv
     … +8 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Bash(export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" && uvx --version)
  ⎿  uvx 0.8.23 (00d3aa378 2025-10-04)

⏺ Perfect! Now, do you have an Axiomatic API key? If yes, provide it and I'll configure the MCPs. If
  not, you'll need to request one from their form.

  Meanwhile, let me start setting up the self-improving AI agentic workflow infrastructure:

     performance through feedback loops, focusing on mathematical, physical, and engineering
     computations.
     ## Features
     - **Self-Improving Architecture**: Agents learn from execution results and optimize strategies
     - **Multi-Domain Focus**: Math, Physics, and Engineering applications
     - **Rich Visualization**: Real-time rendering of computational results
     - **MCP Integration**: Leverages Axiomatic AI's advanced scientific computing tools

> for example: you could learn and replicate the material here
  https://www.flexcompute.com/tidy3d/learning-center/fdtd101/ and here
  https://www.flexcompute.com/tidy3d/learning-center/example-library , using one or mutlipe agents.

  i want everything to be organized via gh, making use of test-driven-development with rule-based tests
  and LLM-based tests .

  take screen-shots or videos to compose impressive 30-45second-long agentic workflows.

  use specifications and tests/evals (stored and adjustable by me) on github to guide the entire project
  in this repo


  orchestrate contracts through github so that contributors (agents) with speciallized tooling (eg
  specalized simualtion tools) contribute those tools; thus, we have a multitude of general-purpose and
  speicalzied claude code agent (teams) who contribute their specialized knowledge and environment and
  tooling, all orchestrated via gh contracting and ci-cd
