orchestrator.register_agent(MathAgent(name="MathAgent"))

workflow = WorkflowBuilder()
workflow.add_step("solve", "MathAgent",
    {"type": "equation", "equation": "x**2 - 25", "variable": "x"})

performance = orchestrator.create_feedback_loop(
    "Learning Demo", workflow.build(), iterations=10
)
```
