# üö® Critic Agent - Vigilant Code Quality Guardian

The Critic Agent is a vigilant and skeptical verification assistant that performs comprehensive analysis of code, explanations, and reasoning to detect mockups, hallucinations, hand-wavy logic, and oversimplified implementations.

## üéØ Mission

**"Show me the proof or show me the door."**

The Critic Agent never assumes correctness. It tests everything. If a claim can't be verified or traced to a reliable method, it flags it clearly.

## üîç Core Capabilities

### Detection Priorities
- **Mockups**: Code that pretends to work but doesn't
- **Hallucinations**: Features that don't exist
- **Assumptions**: Hidden dependencies and magic numbers
- **Security**: Any exec(), eval(), or unsanitized input
- **Physics**: Violations of fundamental laws
- **Math**: Unproven assertions, missing error bounds

### Verification Tools
- **Formal Proof Checker**: Mathematical correctness validation
- **Symbolic Math Verifier**: Equation and algorithm verification
- **Security Scanner**: Vulnerability detection
- **Edge Case Generator**: Boundary condition testing
- **Assumption Detector**: Hidden dependency identification

## üö® Rejection Triggers

The Critic Agent will **REJECT** code containing:
- `TODO` in production code
- Placeholder values
- Missing error handling
- Unverified claims
- No test coverage
- Hand-wavy explanations
- Empty implementations (`pass` statements)
- Weak assertions (`assert True`)

## üìä Analysis Categories

### 1. Security Analysis
- **Pattern Detection**: Scans for dangerous code patterns
- **Input Validation**: Checks for unsanitized inputs
- **Dependency Analysis**: Reviews external dependencies
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Uses bandit and safety tools

### 2. Mathematical Correctness
- **Equation Solving**: Verifies mathematical solutions
- **Integration Testing**: Validates calculus operations
- **Optimization Verification**: Checks optimization results
- **Symbolic Math**: Validates symbolic computations

### 3. Physics Consistency
- **Unit Validation**: Ensures dimensional consistency
- **Physical Laws**: Verifies conservation laws
- **Boundary Conditions**: Checks physical constraints
- **Constant Verification**: Validates physical constants

### 4. Code Quality
- **Implementation Completeness**: No placeholder code
- **Error Handling**: Proper exception management
- **Documentation**: Clear explanations and proofs
- **Maintainability**: Clean, readable code

### 5. Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end validation
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark validation
- **Edge Case Tests**: Boundary condition coverage

## üìö Examples

### Mathematical Verification
```python
# The Critic Agent will verify this solution
task = {
    "type": "equation",
    "equation": "x**2 - 4",
    "variable": "x"
}
result = agent.execute_with_learning(task)
# Expected: solutions = [-2, 2]
```

### Physics Validation
```python
# The Critic Agent will check physical consistency
task = {
    "type": "mechanics",
    "subtype": "kinematics",
    "initial_velocity": 10,
    "acceleration": -9.8,
    "time": 1.0
}
# The Critic Agent will verify:
# - Velocity decreases (acceleration is negative)
# - Position changes appropriately
# - Units are consistent
```
